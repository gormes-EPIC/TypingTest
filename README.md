# Task 0.1 Typing Speed Test

Create a new Python file and write a program to time a typing test.

Game Logic:
1. Print a sentence. It can be the same sentence every time.  
2. Time how long it takes the user to type and submit their response
3. Return how long it took them and how many mistakes they had

**Tip:** Use `time.time()` to get the time in seconds since the [epoch](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#epoch) as a floating-point number. This way you can easily subtract a time from another time!
